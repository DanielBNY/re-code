# RinU
RinU is a cloud-based platform for binary reverse engineers. With RinU there’s no more local computer limitation because heavy computation and massive databases are on the cloud. RinU improves the collaboration between reverse engineers and removes duplicate and redundant work. RinU divides the research lifecycle into 6 parts. The first part is Extractors that extract information from the input sample on the cloud, like disassemble/decompile/de-obfuscate as a service. Second is a Collaboration Platform that provides a platform for reverse engineers to work easily together on a project, And a community-driven collaboration that connects between people work to remove duplicate analysis. The third is a Research Cloud environment for research so users can create VMs with chosen OS, deploy samples to investigate, and remote debug it. With this vision, the reverse engineer will not run on their systems samples or maintain VMs environment. Fourth is Analyzers that analyze information to automate the researcher's work, like functionality detection, library detections, recovering of files, and folder hierarchy. The Analysis is done in the cloud and doesn’t depend on user host specs. The fifth is Visualizers that represent the analyzed and extracted information to text or graphs. The sixth is the Repository where all the data is stored and structured.
